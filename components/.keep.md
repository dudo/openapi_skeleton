# Input and Output Models

The global components/schemas section lets you define common data structures used in your API. They can be referenced via $ref whenever a schema is required â€“ in parameters, request bodies, and response bodies. For example, this JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "name": "Arthur Dent"
}
```

can be represented as:

```yml
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
      # Both properties are required
      required:
        - id
        - name
```

and then referenced in the request body schema and response body schema as follows:

```yml
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Returns a user by ID.
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: userId
          required: true
          type: integer
      responses:
        '200':
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
  /users:
    post:
      summary: Creates a new user.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Created
```

## Authentication

The securitySchemes and security keywords are used to describe the authentication methods used in your API.

```yml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
security:
  - BasicAuth: []
```

Supported authentication methods are:

- HTTP authentication: Basic, Bearer, and so on.
- API key as a header or query parameter or in cookies
- OAuth 2
- OpenID Connect Discovery
